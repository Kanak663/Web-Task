Let us now study some interesting facts about Dr. A P J Abdul Kalam:</p>

<ul type="circle">
<li>His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam.</li> 

<li>He was born in a Tamil Muslim Family. 

<li>Kalam had sold newspapers to supplement his family’s income.

<li>3) He accomplished Aeronautical Engineering from Madras Institute of Technology in 1960.

<li>Kalam was a vegeterian. In his words “I was forced to become a vegetarian due to financial constraints, but I eventually came to enjoy it.” Today, I am a complete vegetarian”

<li>He was India’s ‘first bachelor President.

<li>He was very popular among children. 

<li>Kalam’s autobiography ‘Wings of Fire was initially published in English Language but then later published in 13 other languages. 

    <li>. During his presidency, Kalam was so beloved that people requested that he take the office again after Pratibha Patil’s term as President. However, he politely refused.</li>

    <li>Kalam valued Dr. Vikram Sarabhai as his mentor. He turned to this other great scientist of Indian origin for advice and support.

</ul>
Although the life of Abdul Kalam was filled with struggles and hardships, he rose above the adversaries to become one of the greatest scientists of modern India. His role in nation-building will be remembered till posterity.

Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was Agni, India’s first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the SLV-III and was launched in 1989.
